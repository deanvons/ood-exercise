# Library Management System Refactoring Activity

## Overview

This activity focuses on refactoring a library management system using SOLID principles. The aim is to transform the system from a tightly coupled and low cohesion design to a more maintainable, adaptable, and loosely coupled architecture.

### Branches

- **Main**: Contains the starting point of the project. This version of the system has tight coupling and low cohesion.
- **Solution**: This branch contains the refactored version of the system, adhering to SOLID principles.

## Activity Objective

The goal of this activity is to refactor the library management system in the `Main` branch by applying SOLID principles. You will start with a system that has tightly coupled classes and low cohesion and work towards making it more modular, maintainable, and scalable.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository and checking out the `Main` branch.

2. **Analyze the Current System**: Review the existing code on the `Main` branch to understand its structure and dependencies.

3. **Identify Issues**: Identify areas where the system is tightly coupled and lacks cohesion. Make a note of these areas for reference during the refactoring process.

4. **Refactor**: Switch to the `Solution` branch. Here, SOLID principles were applied to refactor the system. Focused on:
   - Separating concerns and responsibilities into different classes.
   - Reducing dependencies between classes to achieve loose coupling.
   - Enhancing cohesion within individual classes.

5. **Compare and Learn**: After refactoring, compare your solution with the provided refactored version in the `Solution` branch. Analyze the differences and understand the rationale behind each refactoring decision.

6. **Test and Validate**: Ensure that the refactored system is functioning as expected. Write tests to validate the behavior of the system and its components.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this activity, you should have a clear understanding of how to apply SOLID principles to improve the design of a software system. The refactored library management system should demonstrate the benefits of these principles in creating a more robust, adaptable, and maintainable software architecture.
